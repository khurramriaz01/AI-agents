# 🤖 AI Agents

This repository hosts a collection of AI-driven automation tools developed in Python, aimed at enhancing productivity through intelligent agents.

## 📁 Project Overview

The `AI-agents` project encompasses various autonomous agents tailored for specific tasks. Key components include:

* **`main.py`**: The primary script orchestrating agent behaviors and interactions.
* **`Library_bot.json`**: Configuration file detailing parameters and settings for the Library Bot agent.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the agents seamlessly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khurramriaz01/AI-agents.git
cd AI-agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### Running the Agent

Execute the main script to initiate the agent:

```bash
python main.py
```



Ensure that `Library_bot.json` is properly configured to match your desired agent settings.

## 🧠 Features

* **Modular Design**: Easily extend or modify agents for various tasks.
* **Configurable Agents**: Customize agent behaviors through JSON configurations.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to accommodate additional agents and functionalities.

## 🛠️ Configuration

The `Library_bot.json` file allows you to tailor the agent's behavior. Key parameters include:

* **`agent_name`**: Name of the agent.
* **`task_list`**: List of tasks the agent is designed to perform.
* **`response_mode`**: Determines how the agent responds (e.g., verbose, concise).

Modify these parameters to suit your specific requirements.
